# BDC Homework 1 - Fair K-Means Clustering

## Description

The purpose of the first homework is to get acquainted with Spark and with its use to implement MapReduce algorithms, in particular, concerning a variant of the classical Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering, which enforces a fairness constraint on the solution based on extra demographic information attached to the input points.

**Course:** Big Data Computing (2024/2025).

## Test the implementation
